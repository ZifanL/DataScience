Mr <person>Howard</> said the "grossly disproportionate" test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders. The issue entered the public spotlight when Norfolk farmer <person>Tony Martin</> was jailed for shooting dead a 16-year-old burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm. But the home secretary said Mr <person>Howard</> was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars. The barrister who had represented Mr <person>Martin</> had said the rules were "weighted overwhelmingly" in favour of the householder, said Mr <person>Clarke</>. He said: "The problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point Sir <person>John Stevens</> was making and the prime minister was making." The new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue, added Mr <person>Clarke</>. The director of public prosecutions, <person>Ken Macdonald</>, says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. Those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar, tied him up, beat him and set him alight, he said. Tory MP <person>Patrick Mercer</>'s private member's bill to change the law received a first reading in Parliament on Wednesday and goes to a full debate next month.
