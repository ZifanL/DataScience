During an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr <person>Balls</> said he was sure Mr <person>Brown</>'s Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. "I don't think we'll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001," he said.

His assurances came after Sir <person>Digby Jones</> said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills. His message to the chancellor was: "Please don't give it away in any form of electioneering." Sir <person>Digby</> added: "I don't think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. "We would say to him 'don't increase your public spending, don't give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people'. "That would be a good way to spend any excess."

Mr <person>Balls</> refused to say whether Mr <person>Brown</> would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary. "I think that <person>Gordon Brown</> wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards," Mr <person>Balls</> told Today. Prime Minister <person>Tony Blair</> has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May.
