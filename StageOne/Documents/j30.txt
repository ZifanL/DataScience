<person>Brown</> shrugs off economy fears

<person>Gordon Brown</> is to freeze petrol duty increases, fund a £1bn package to avoid big council tax rises and boost childcare and maternity leave.

In an upbeat pre-Budget report, he slightly increased borrowing but insisted economic targets would be met. The chancellor also hailed the longest period of growth in UK "industrial history" but denied he was "gloating". But <person>Oliver Letwin</>, for the Tories, attacked government red tape and debt, dubbing Mr <person>Brown</> "Sir Wastealot".

The shadow chancellor said Mr <person>Brown</>'s "golden rule" had "turned to dross in his hands" and said he was borrowing to spend, not invest, with predicted debt over the coming years totalling £170bn. Mr <person>Letwin</> told MPs: "The tide is going out on the chancellor's credibility. He is spending, borrowing and taxing so much because he is not getting value for taxpayer's money."

<person>Vincent Cable</>, for the Liberal Democrats, accused Mr <person>Brown</> of ducking tough choices.

He said: "Last week the prime minister gave us the politics of fear; this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency. "There are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the UK housing market and rising personal debt. But they have not been confronted." Mr <person>Brown</> rejected the Lib Dem's call to open up the government's books to the National Audit Office, saying decisions on tax and spending should be made by ministers. Some economists say his forecasts on public finances are wishful thinking. BBC economic editor <person>Evan Davis</> said the figures were plausible but also a gamble.
