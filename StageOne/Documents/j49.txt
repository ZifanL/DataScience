Tories attack burglar 'U-turns'

Tory leader <person>Michael Howard</> has accused <person>Tony Blair</> of performing U-turns over rules on using force against burglars.

The government has ruled out amending the present law, which allows "reasonable force" in self defence. Mr <person>Howard</> branded the decision unacceptable, saying: "It is not householders who should be frightened, it's the burglars." Home Secretary <person>Charles Clarke</> said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir <person>John Stevens</> last month backed a Tory attempt to change the law so only householders using "grossly disproportionate" force could be prosecuted. The pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and Crown Prosecution Service would be consulted as part of a review of the law. He told MPs: "If we get the right response from those people, we will, of course, support a change in the law." Instead, the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves. On Thursday, Mr <person>Howard</> told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr <person>Blair</> had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again. He said: "We've had three policy positions in three months and two U-turns. "It's not surprising <person>Gordon Brown</> told him: 'There's nothing you could say to me now that I could ever believe.'"
