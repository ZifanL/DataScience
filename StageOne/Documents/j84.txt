His lawyer <person>Louise Christian</> said: "'We are hoping to issue proceedings for the misfeasance of officials who colluded with the Americans in effectively kidnapping him and taking him to Guantanamo." And <person>Menzies Campbell</>, the Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, said it was vital to establish whether ministers approved Mr <person>Mubanga</>'s transfer to Guantanamo. But a Foreign Office spokesman said he could not comment on the activities of British intelligence or security agencies. And Home Secretary <person>Charles Clarke</> told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost: "I'm not organising a specific investigation into it." Mr <person>Mubanga</> is the first of the four detainees freed last month to give a media interview. He told the Observer his worst moment was when he was told he would be released last March, only to be confined and told he would be there for many more years.

He claimed he was stripped of his clothes and mattress and forced to remain in an empty metal box, naked except for boxer shorts. And he said an interrogator used a mop to daub him with his own urine while he was chained hand and foot. Mr <person>Mubanga</>, who insists he does not feel bitter, said: "I've lost three years of my life, because I was a Muslim. He added: "The authorities wanted to break me but they strengthened me. They've made me what I am - even if I'm not quite sure yet who that person is." The US government denied the claims, saying it condemned and prohibited torture. In a statement, it said: "The Department of Defense has no doubt that Mr <person>Mubanga</> was properly detained as an enemy combatant under the laws of war. "He was detained to prevent him from fighting against the US and our allies in the war on terror." But Fair Trials Abroad director <person>Stephen Jakobi</> said there were similarities between Mr <person>Mubanga</>'s account and those of other Guantanamo detainees. He said: "The pattern is the same. The real problem is the concentration camp conditions in Guantanamo. "Is [<person>Charles Clarke</>] really pretending this is all made up?" Mr <person>Mubanga</> and the three other freed British detainees were released without charge by UK police on their return from Cuba.
