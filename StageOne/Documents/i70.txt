UK heading wrong way - <person>Howard<person>

<person>Tony Blair</> has had the chance to tackle the problems facing Britain and has failed, <person>Michael Howard</> has said.

"Britain is heading in the wrong direction", the Conservative leader said in his New Year message. Mr <person>Blair</>'s government was a "bossy, interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals," he added. But Labour's campaign spokesman <person>Fraser Kemp</> responded: "Britain is working, don't let the Tories wreck it again". Mr <person>Howard</> also paid tribute to the nation's character for its generous response to the Asian quake disaster. The catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year, Mr <person>Howard</> said.

"We watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. The scale, the speed, the ferocity of what happened on Boxing Day is difficult to grasp. "Yet Britain's response has shone a light on our nation's character. The last week has shown that the warm, caring heart of Britain beats as strong as ever." He went on to reflect on the values that "most Britons hold dear". Looking ahead to the coming general election, he pledged to "turn these beliefs into reality" and set out the choices he says are facing Britain. "How much tax do people want to pay? Who will give taxpayers value for money, the clean hospitals and good, disciplined schools they want? "Who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system?"
