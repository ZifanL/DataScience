The Liberal Democrats said it "beggared belief" he and fellow officials could not remember how <person>Leoncia Casalme</>'s application for indefinite leave to remain went from Mr <person>Blunkett</>'s office to the head of the Immigration and Nationality Department. Meanwhile, the Conservatives accused officials of a "collective failure" of memory. But Sir <person>Alan Budd</>, who led an inquiry into the affair, said he had no reason to believe anyone involved had deliberately withheld information.

Downing Street defended the decision to honour both men, with a spokesperson saying: "You have to look at their whole career." Sir <person>John</> was made permanent secretary in April 2001 following a Civil Service career which dates back to 1974. He has also worked in the Treasury and the Department of Employment. A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said of Mr <person>Smith</>'s honour: "The award reflects all that he has achieved in a Civil Service career, principally in the Inland Revenue, spanning over 40 years - not just his role as chief executive of the Child Support Agency.

"In his career he has personally led a number of successful major change programmes." Mr <person>Smith</> is set to stay on at the CSA until March. Less controversial will be the knighthoods for <person>Derek Wanless</> and <person>Mike Tomlinson</>, who undertook major government reviews on health and education respectively. Former NatWest chief executive Mr <person>Wanless</>, 57, has delivered not one but two major reports on the NHS. Ex-chief inspector of schools Mr <person>Tomlinson</>, 62, has recommended replacing A-Levels and GCSEs with a new diploma system in a shake-up of the exams system.
