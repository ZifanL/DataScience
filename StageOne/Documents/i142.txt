The other protesters are <person>John Holliday</>, 37, a huntsman from Ledbury, Herefordshire, <person>Robert Thame</>, 34, who plays polo with Princes Charles in Team Highgrove, auctioneer <person>Andrew Elliot</>, 42, from Bromesberrow, near Ledbury, point-to-point jockey <person>Richard Wakeham</>, 34, from York, and former royal chef <person>Nick Wood</>, 41. The 15 September protest came on the same day as a huge pro-hunting demonstration in Parliament Square. Four of the men ran out from behind the speaker's chair while another wrestled past a doorkeeper from a different entrance. The five tried to confront MPs before they were bundled out of the chamber and later led away handcuffed by police. Three others had been intercepted by security staff as they tried to join the five in the chamber.

Speaker <person>Michael Martin</> later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the House of Commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder. In November, the use of the Parliament Act meant a total ban on hunting with dogs in England and Wales. However, many pro-hunt activists remained defiant after the law was passed, saying they would ignore the ban and continue to hunt. Last week, the Countryside Alliance said more than 250 hunts would meet legally the day after the ban on hunting with dogs comes into force. The alliance said the 19 February meets would show the new law was "impossibly difficult to determine" and open to different interpretations.
