<person>Campbell</> rescues <person>Arsenal</>

<person>Sol Campbell</> proved to be an unlikely match-winner to earn <person>Arsenal</> a hard-fought win at Portsmouth.

The England defender lashed home a 25-yard shot for his first goal in 16 months to take <person>Arsenal</> back into second spot, five points behind Chelsea. But before <person>Campbell</> scored the best two chances of the game fell to Pompey striker <person>Ricardo Fuller</>. In the first half he blasted wide when clear, and his control let him down in the second half when well placed. <person>Portsmouth</> got plenty of bodies behind the ball to deny <person>Arsenal</> space in the early stages. But their marking was slack at a corner and <person>Patrick Vieira</> should have done better when the ball fell to him 16 yards out. A mistake by <person>Arjan de Zeeuw</> let <person>Thierry Henry</> in behind the <person>Pompey</> defence on 17 minutes but as he bore down on goal <person>Linvoy Primus</> got in a saving tackle. With just <person>Fuller</> as an out-and-out striker, <person>Portsmouth</>'s shape made life difficult for <person>Arsenal</>. But a delightful touch by <person>Robin van Persie</> gave <person>Henry</> a sight of goal, although the angle was too tight for his shot to trouble <person>Jamie Ashdown</>.

<person>Ashdown</> caused hearts to flutter on 28 minutes when he missed his punch at a corner and <person>Kolo Toure headed just wide and, as <person>Arsenal began to press, <person>Van Persie </>blasted over a good opportunity after <person>Henry</> had set him up. <person>Henry took a quick return pass from Vieira but <person>Ashdown</> was out quickly to block, and there were some anxious seconds for Pompey as the ball ran loose before <person>Matthew Taylor</> cleared. After playing second fiddle, <person>Portsmouth</> should have taken the lead on 34 minutes. Referee <person>Howard Webb</> played a good advantage to allow <person>Steve Stone</> to send <person>Gary O'Neil</> away but, having shrugged off Toure, the Pompey midfielder planted his shot wide from 10 yards. As half-time approached, <person>Henry</> teased a shot through a ruck of players and inches wide. At the other end,<person>Fuller</> broke clear but failed to hit the target as Toure closed him down.

<person>Fuller</> was given the best chance of the match so far on 48 minutes when <person>Patrik Berger</>'s break and slipped pass played him clear. But a poor first touch lost him the opportunity and even when he checked back and went down under <person>Vieira</>'s challenge, referee <person>Webb</> was not interested. <person>Fuller</> paid the price when he gave way on 55 minutes to <person>Aiyegbeni Yakubu</>, who returned after six weeks out with a knee injury. But it needed alert reflexes and safe handling from <person>Ashdown</> to cling on to <person>Van Persie</>'s shot as <person>Henry</> sniffed for scraps.

 <person>Portsmouth</> were growing in confidence and keeper <person>Manuel Almunia</> had to stand his ground to beat away a powerful shot from <person>Berger</>. <person>Arsenal</> were struggling to find their rhythm but took the lead through the unlikely source of <person>Campbell</>. The England defender needed little invitation as Pompey backed off to stride forward and lash a ferocious shot past <person>Ashdown</>. <person>Arsenal</> might have stretched their lead two minutes later when <person>Mathieu Flamini</> escaped his marker to flash a header wide from <person>Henry</>'s free-kick. <person>Almunia</> went full length to grab <person>Berger's long-range shot, while <person>Ashdown</> palmed away substitute <person>Dennis Bergkamp</>'s shot.

<person>Ashdown</>, <person>Griffin</>, <person>De Zeeuw</>, <person>Primus</>, <person>Taylor</>, <person>Stone</>, <person>O'Neil</>, <person>Faye</> (<person>Berkovic</> 83), <person>Berger</>, <person>LuaLua</>, <person>Fuller</> (<person>Yakubu </>55).
