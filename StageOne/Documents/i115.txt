<person>Brown</> ally rejects Budget spree

Chancellor <person>Gordon Brown</>'s closest ally has denied suggestions there will be a Budget giveaway on 16 March.

<person>Ed Balls</>, ex-chief economic adviser to the Treasury, said there would be no spending spree before polling day. But Mr <person>Balls</>, a prospective Labour MP, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. He was speaking as Sir <person>Digby Jones</>, CBI director general, warned Mr <person>Brown</> not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes.

Mr <person>Balls</>, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr <person>Brown</> would meet his golden economic rule - "with a margin to spare". He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules.

He also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. "If the MPC (the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I'm not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour," he told a Parliamentary lunch. "This is a big change in our political culture."
