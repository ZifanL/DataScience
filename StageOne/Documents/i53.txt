Commons hunt protest charges

Eight protesters who stormed the House of Commons chamber during a debate on the Hunting Bill have been charged with disorderly conduct.

The men were arrested in September after bursting into the chamber causing a hunting ban debate to be halted. Those charged included <person>Otis Ferry</>, the 22-year-old son of rock star <person>Bryan Ferry</> and <person>Luke Tomlinson</>, 27, a close friend of princes <person>William</> and <person>Harry</>. They were charged under Section 5 of the Public Order Act, police said.

Five of the eight men held an impromptu news conference outside Charing Cross Police Station on Monday evening, after the charges were formerly put to them. The men's solicitor <person>Matthew Knight</>, said that at no time had it occurred to the men that they were committing a criminal offence.

"There is no offence of trespassing in the House of Commons - it is not a criminal offence," he said. "If Parliament wanted to make entering the House of Commons chamber on foot a criminal offence it should have done so, but it can't do so retrospectively. "We are not prosecuted for that. We are prosecuted for a Public Order Act offence. We are not guilty of it." They will appear at Bow Street Magistrates' Court on 21 December, a police spokesman said. <person>Otis Ferry</>, a former Eton pupil and joint leader of the South Shropshire Hunt, said: "I have no regrets. "We have done nothing wrong beyond the obvious which was to stand up for our rights and not act like a sheep like the rest of the country." One of the men, <person>David Redvers</>, 34, from Hartpury, Gloucestershire, said he and the other seven protesters would plead not guilty to the charges.
