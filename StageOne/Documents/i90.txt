Royal couple watch nation's mood

Prince <person>Charles</> and <person>Camilla Parker Bowles</> are awaiting the nation's reaction after announcing they are to be married on 8 April.

Mrs <person>Parker Bowles</> will take the title HRH Duchess of Cornwall after a civil ceremony to be held at Windsor Castle. A Daily Telegraph poll of 1,313 people suggests two-thirds of Britons support the couple's decision to marry. But only 40% think Mrs <person>Parker Bowles</> should become Princess <person>Consort</> as planned after <person>Charles</> becomes king. Some 47% believe she should have no title, while 7% think she should become queen.

The poll also found that the majority of Britons would prefer the monarchy to miss a generation, with the Queen handing the throne to her grandson Prince <person>William</>, 22, on her death or abdication. On Thursday night, Prince <person>Charles</>, 56, and Mrs <person>Parker Bowles</>, 57, hosted a dinner at Windsor Castle, their first public appearance since announcing their engagement. Mrs <person>Parker Bowles</> said the prince went down on one knee to propose and added: "I'm just coming down to earth." She displayed her diamond engagement ring - a royal family heirloom - to reporters. <person>Charles</> said he and his wife-to-be were "absolutely delighted". Their marriage will end years of speculation on a relationship which dates back to 1970.
