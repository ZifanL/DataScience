Low-budget film wins Cesar

A film that follows a group of alienated youth in a Paris suburb as they prepare to perform an 18th Century play has won France's top cinema award.

L'Esquive earned a Cesar prize for its director, Tunisian-born <person> Abdellatif Kechiche </> , and its young star, the 18-year-old actress <person> Sara Forestier </> . It saw off competition from big-budget French epic, A Very Long Engagement, and the box-office hit, The Chorus. US film Lost in Translation won the award for best foreign feature. The wistful romantic comedy directed by <person> Sofia Coppola </> has already won several awards, including an Oscar for best screenplay in 2004. Its late release in France made it a contender for this year's Cesars.
