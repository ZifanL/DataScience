Asked if Mr <person>Blunkett</> could return to frontline politics at some point, he replied: "I have made my admiration for David very clear and it remains. "He's been a tremendous colleague, he's done a great job for us, first as home secretary then as education secretary. The future is something we will have to approach in the future." The prime minister shrugged off claims from Conservative leader <person>Michael Howard</> that he led a "grubby government". He said Mr <person>Blunkett</>'s integrity remained intact: "He was the person first of all who asked for this inquiry to be set up. He accepted that what he originally thought had happened had not happened, he said. "But I think Sir <person>Alan Budd</> also accepted there wasn't some conspiracy or cover-up and I just think a line should be drawn under now and we should move on."

Earlier, Mr <person>Howard</> said: "There does need to be another inquiry, a judge-led inquiry. There were so many questions that weren't answered." There was "deceit at the heart of government" which was not limited to the visa affair, he argued. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman <person>Mark Oaten</> also said there was "a strong case for a judge-led judicial review".

He said: "Next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. It may be about something even more important than that." Mr <person>Blunkett</> quit as home secretary last week after being told in advance of Sir <person>Alan</>'s findings. In a statement, the ex-home secretary said he accepted the inquiry's findings. He said he had told the truth throughout and had raised the nanny case as an example of unacceptable backlogs in the system.
