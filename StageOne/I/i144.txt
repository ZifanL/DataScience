<person>Blunkett</> row should end - <person> Blair </> 

Prime Minister <person>Tony Blair</> said it was time to draw a line under the controversy surrounding <person>David Blunkett</>.

The Tories and the Lib Dems have called for a second inquiry into the fast-tracking of a visa application for Mr <person>Blunkett</>'s ex-lover's nanny. Sir <person>Alan Budd</> found a "chain of events" linked Mr <person>Blunkett</> to <person>Leoncia Casalme</>'s indefinite leave to remain application. At the end of his Middle East trip, Mr <person>Blair</> said he still admired Mr <person>Blunkett</> and thought his integrity was intact.

On Tuesday Sir <person>Alan</> said the application for leave to remain in the UK made by <person>Kimberly Quinn</>'s nanny was processed in 52 days, 120 days faster than the average. But he could not find evidence to show whether Mr <person>Blunkett</>'s intervention was intended to give special help for his then lover's nanny - or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance. In his first comments since Sir <person>Alan</>'s announcement, Mr <person>Blair</> told BBC News he had not yet read the report in detail. But told BBC News: "As far as I'm concerned, we have drawn a line under that."
