Visa row mandarin made Sir <person>John</>

The top civil servant at the centre of the <person>David Blunkett</> visa affair has been knighted in the New Year Honours.

Sir <person>John Gieve</> was Home Office permanent secretary during the saga which ended with Mr <person>Blunkett</> quitting. He and other civil servants were criticised for failing to recall how the visa for Mr <person>Blunkett</>'s ex-lover's nanny came to be fast-tracked. The outgoing head of the troubled Child Support Agency <person>Doug Smith</> also earns an honour in the New Year's list. Mr <person>Smith</>, 57, whose retirement was announced by Work and Pensions Secretary <person>Alan Smith</> in November, is made a Commander of the Order of Bath.

Both men were giving evidence to a Commons committee on the computer difficulties facing the agency, which left thousands of single parents without any maintenance payments, when the announcement was made. The knighting of Sir <person>John</>, 54, will be received with astonishment by opposition politicians.
