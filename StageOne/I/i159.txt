In Britain, the Queen and Prince <person>Philip</> will lead the nation's commemoration at a service in Westminster Hall, London. The Queen will also host a reception for holocaust survivors at St James's Palace. Altogether, some six million people, mainly Jews, perished in the Holocaust. The Queen's grandson, Prince <person>Harry</>, sparked outrage earlier this week after photographs of him wearing a Nazi uniform at a costume party emerged. The prince, 20, apologised, but critics have called for him to go to Auschwitz for the commemoration of the Soviets' 1945 liberation of the camp. Prince <person>Harry</> should see for himself "the results of the hated symbol he so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear", <person>Rabbi Marvin Hier</>, founder of Jewish human rights group the Simon Wiesenthal Center said.
