The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh said the news had made them "very happy". Princes <person>William</> and <person>Harry</> said they are "very happy" and wish the couple "all the luck in the future". The wedding will be a civil ceremony followed by a service of prayer and dedication in St George's Chapel at which the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr <person>Rowan Williams</>, will preside.

The marriage is likely to be a sensitive issue because Mrs <person>Parker Bowles</> is divorced and her former husband is still alive. If he became king, <person>Charles</> would be the supreme governor of the Church of England and some Anglicans remain opposed to the remarriage of divorcees. "His divorce from <person>Diana</> and the disappointment the country felt over how <person>Diana</> had been treated... opened up a sense of disillusionment with [Prince <person>Charles</>]," said <person>Ros Coward</>, who wrote the authorised biography of <person>Diana</>, princess of Wales. The Archbishop of Canterbury said: "I am pleased that Prince <person>Charles</> and Mrs <person>Camilla Parker Bowles</> have decided to take this important step." <person>Tony Blair</> said he was "delighted" for the couple and offered his congratulations, as did Conservative leader <person>Michael Howard</> and Liberal Democrat leader <person>Charles Kennedy</>. Australia's Prime Minister <person>John Howard</> also offered his congratulations, adding that their decision to marry was a "sensible and a good thing". Mrs <person>Parker Bowles</> has joined the prince at numerous engagements in recent years - mostly at evening events for The Prince's Trust. Clarence House staff were at pains to point out that she attended these events in a private capacity.
