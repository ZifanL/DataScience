<person>Blair</> and <person>Blunkett</> Sheffield trip

<person>Tony Blair</> is to join Home Secretary <person>David Blunkett</> in a visit to Sheffield on Thursday.

Mr <person>Blunkett</>'s conduct is being looked at to establish whether he abused his position in relation to his ex-lover. The Parliamentary standards watchdog is looking at his decision to give <person>Kimberly Quinn</> free rail tickets. He is also being investigated over the visa application of Mrs <person>Quinn</>'s ex-nanny. The visit to Sheffield will be seen as a show of unity by Mr <person>Blair</>.

On Wednesday during Prime Minister's Questions, Tory leader <person>Michael Howard</> went on the offensive over comments Mr <person>Blunkett</> is alleged to have made in a new biography. He is understood to have made a series of criticisms about his Cabinet colleagues from the prime minister down. Mr <person>Howard</> said Mr <person>Blunkett</> had complained he had inherited a "giant mess" when he took over at the Home Office from <person>Jack Straw</>, now foreign secretary. The Tory leader went on: "He doesn't stop there: he thinks the culture secretary's weak; he thinks the trade secretary doesn't think strategically and he thinks the education secretary hasn't developed as expected. "He says the prime minister doesn't like being told the truth and the chancellor - no doubt the prime minister will agree with this - is a bully." Mr <person>Blair</> retorted voters remembered the record of a government and no comments by politicians.
