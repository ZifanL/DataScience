Mr <person>Blair</> has failed to tackle these problems, he claimed, saying he has the "wrong solution" to them.

"The result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives, undermining enterprise and denying people choice. "Worst of all, it is a government that has wasted people's money and failed to tackle the problems families face today." The Tories, he said, can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes. "We can have progress without losing what makes Britain great - its tolerance, the respect for the rule of law, the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential. "We simply need to change direction. The election will give Britain the chance to change." This is the record Mr <person>Blair</> will have to defend in the coming months, he said, urging voters to hold him to account.

But Labour spokesman Mr <person>Kemp</> said: "It would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 April, not 1 January." "Let us never forget that when <person>Michael Howard</> was in government Britain suffered mass unemployment, 15% interest rates, record home repossessions, and the introduction of the poll tax. "With Labour Britain is working. Rather than alluding to false promises <person>Michael Howard</> should be starting 2005 with an apology to the British people for the misery that the government, of which he was a member, inflicted upon the country.
